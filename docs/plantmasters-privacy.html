    <h1>Plant Masters - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

    <p>Neuroplastic Labs ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Plant Masters mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect your email address and password. Passwords are securely hashed and stored via our authentication provider (Supabase). We never store passwords in plain text.</p>

    <h3>Profile Information</h3>
    <p>You may optionally provide a nickname, bio, and location for your public profile. You control whether your location is visible to other users.</p>

    <h3>Plant Photos</h3>
    <p>When you use our plant identification and diagnosis features, photos you capture or select are sent to our servers for AI analysis. Photos are processed to generate plant care reports and are stored in your analysis history.</p>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>With your permission, we collect approximate location data to connect you with local plant communities and provide region-specific plant care recommendations. You can deny or revoke location access at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <h3>Usage and Analytics</h3>
    <p>We collect anonymized usage data to improve the app experience, including feature usage patterns, app performance metrics, and crash reports. We use third-party services (RevenueCat, Superwall) to manage subscriptions and optimize the user experience.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide plant identification, diagnosis, and care recommendations</li>
        <li>To manage your account and subscription</li>

        <li>To improve app performance and user experience</li>
        <li>To send important service-related communications</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring users can only access their own data. Authentication tokens are stored in your device's Apple Keychain. All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption.</p>
